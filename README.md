# Deep-Learning-Model-for-Song-Prediction-form-huming-Whistling
Building Audio Deep Learning Model for forecasting melody name.  Sound Classification is one of the foremost broadly utilized applications in Audio Deep Learning. It includes learning to classify sounds and to anticipate the category of that sound. I am going begin with sound files, convert them into spectrograms, input them into a CNN plus Linear Classifier model, and create forecasts almost the lesson to which the melody has a place.
